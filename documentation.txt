This file acts as a log for the files that will exist in this project file as a future reference...
boot.asm - a file that constructs a working bootloader in assembly that displays text
makefile - automates building and running
reminder that a bootloader is a small program that initializes a computer or embedded system when powered on
notes about boot.asm 
a. The bootloader runs in real-mode (a default 16-bit system), direct access to all memory and hardware, limited to 1MB of addressable memory
no memory protection between programs and used by DOS (Disk Operating System) and early bootloaders

Conclusion: finished constructing a bootloader and current operating system features include: a basic bootloader displaying text/real mode assembly programming (at 16-bits) and QEMU emulation support

aux-boot.asm - an enhanced version of the previous boot.asm file that was constructed to now have VGA output features
the makefile is also adjusted accordingly to this new boot file that will now be used for further steps of the project
a. The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) tests hardware components and hands off the control to the bootloader
However some versions of systems tend to have BIOS interruptions, in which in this case we eliminate the chance of such events
occuring and write directly to the VGA memory
